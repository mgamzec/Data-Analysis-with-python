The .replace() method allows us to change specific components of a datetime object while keeping the other components unchanged.\nWe then call the .isoformat() method on the resulting datetime object to convert it to an ISO 8601 formatted string, which includes the date, time, and time zone information.\nFinally, we print the ISO formatted string.\nBy following these steps, the solution sets the initial date with the 'Europe/London' time zone, iterates over a range of years, replaces the year in the datetime object, and prints the ISO formatted string for each modified date.

Whereas .resample() groups rows by some time or date information, .groupby() groups rows based on the values in one or more columns. For example, rides.groupby('Member type').size() would tell us how many rides there were by member type in our entire DataFrame.\n\n.resample() can be called after .groupby().

Bölüm: Tarihler\nBu kursun ilk bölümünde Python'daki tarihler üzerinde durduk. date() sınıfı yıl, ay ve gün argümanlarını alır. Bir tarih nesnesinin year gibi erişim özellikleri ve weekday() gibi metotları vardır. Tarih nesneleri sayılar gibi karşılaştırılabilir, min(), max() ve sort() kullanılabilir. Bir tarihten diğerini çıkararak timedelta elde edebilirsiniz. Tarih nesnelerini stringe çevirmek için isoformat() veya strftime() metotlarını kullanın.\n\n2. Bölüm: Tarih ve Zamanları Birleştirmek\nBu kursun ikinci bölümünde tarih ve zamanları ele aldık. datetime() sınıfı date()'in tüm argümanlarını alır, ayrıca saat, dakika, saniye ve mikro saniye ekler. Tüm ek argümanlar opsiyoneldir, aksi takdirde varsayılan olarak sıfıra ayarlanır. datetime içindeki herhangi bir değeri replace() metotuyla değiştirebilirsiniz. timedelta'ı tamsayıya çevirmek için total_seconds() metodunu kullanın. Stringleri tarihe çevirmek için strptime(), tarihleri stringe çevirmek için strftime() kullanın.\n\n3. Bölüm: Zaman Dilimleri ve Yaz Saati\nBu kursun üçüncü bölümünde zaman dilimleri ve yaz saati üzerinde durduk. Bir datetime nesnesi tzinfo ayarlıysa \"zaman dilimi bilincinde\", değilse \"zaman dilimi bilgisiz\"dir. Zaman dilimi ayarlamak, bir datetime nesnesinin evrensel zaman standardı olan UTC ile nasıl uyumlu olacağını belirtir. Bir datetime nesnesinin zaman dilimini değiştirmek için replace() metodunu kullanın, tarih ve saati aynı bırakın. Tarih ve saati yeni zaman dilimine uyacak şekilde ayarlamak için astimezone() metodunu kullanın. dateutil-dot-tz kapsamlı ve güncel bir zaman dilimi veritabanı sağlar.\n\n4. Bölüm: Pandas ile Kolay ve Güçlü Zaman Damgaları\nBu kursun dördüncü ve son bölümünde tarihler ve zamanları işlemek için Pandas kullanımı üzerinde durduk. Bir csv dosyası okurken, parse_dates argümanını tarih ve zaman olarak ayrıştırılacak sütunların listesine ayarlayın. parse_dates işe yaramazsa pd-dot-to_datetime() fonksiyonunu kullanın. Satırları groupby() ile gruplandırmak, grup başına toplamlar hesaplamanıza izin verir. Örneğin, first(), min() veya mean(). resample() satırları yıl, ay, gün vb. bazında bir tarih ve zaman sütununa göre gruplandırır. Zaman dilimini ayarlamak ve tarih ve saati aynı tutmak için tz_localize() kullanın. Tarih ve saati yeni zaman dilimine uyacak şekilde değiştirmek için tz_convert() kullanın.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"f4fe587a-ae78-4c82-86bb-bcd7c83918ea"}],"metadata":{"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.8.10","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"editor":"DataCamp Workspace"},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
